# Data-Structure-Programs
Data structure and algorithms are very important for getting a placement as it helps one to solve programming related problems and helps in cracking campus placements in no time. Data structures refer to the particular way in which data is stored and organized and the allowed operations on the data. The efficiency of an algorithm depends on the data structure used. If its your learning phase then these are the simplest and vital programs to learn first in the Data structure. I was also gone through these in my early days. Keep learning, All the best.
